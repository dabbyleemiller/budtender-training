<h2 id="GLP">Green Life Productions</h2>

<p>Based in Pahrump, Nevada, Green Life Productions, or GLP, is known best for their organic, no-till-soil growing methods. Rather than use pesticides, they use preying mantises as pest control. They also use a network of mushrooms and their mycelium network to transfer nutrients throughout the soil.</p>

<h3>Most Popular Products</h3>
<p><strong>Organic Flower and Bottom Buds</strong> are this company's bread and butter, and are often dropped in small batches.</p>

<p><strong>Rosin</strong> is another popular product they make, solventless concentrate using only heat and pressure to extract cannabinoids and terpenes</p>

<p><strong>Baby J's</strong> are small. .3g prerolled joints that come in a cute little Altoids-type tin.</p>

<h2 id="Wyld">Wyld Gummies</h2>

<p>By far the most popular brand of gummies, they have a distinctly pleasant texture and relatively zero cannabis taste. They are also consistent in effect and their ratioed gummies, those that include CBD, CBN, CBC, or CBG, are also very effective.</p>

<h2 id="mmDev">Medizin, Trendi, Haha, and Dreamland</h2>

<p>These are the major brands of the behemouth Planet 13. They also have a smaller local shop called Medizin. But they are, as to my knowledge, the largest dispensary in the world, and just added their consumption lounge that I believe just opened. They have many signature strains and mammoth production ability.</p>

<p><strong>Medizin Flower</strong> is the cornerstone, under which they also have concentrates, most notably their live resin. They also do cartridges and prerolls</p>

<p><strong>Trendi</strong> is their more experimental brand, focusing also on concetrates and vapes.</p>

<p><strong>Haha Gummies and Dreamland Chocolate</strong> are both made onsite and are the edible side of their product line.</p>

<h2 id="naturesChem">Nature's Chemistry</h2>

<p>Nature's Chem is generally known for its high-potency flower and its high terpenes. They have great signature strains such as Ghost Train Haze, Blue Hash Plant, and Garlic Cookies.</p>
