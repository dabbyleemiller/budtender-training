<h1>Basic Budtender Training</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello! I have written this website after four years in the legal Nevada Cannabis Industry to help new Budtenders get into the game quickly and to suggest new things for seasoned Budtenders to consider, as well as some supplemental materials I've come across that I find helpful.</p>

<p>This version is very rudimentary and will basically just be text. I will slowly be adding interactive elements, videos, images, and maybe even some games to help strengthen your understanding of cannabis and to enhance your ability to care for your customers.</p>

<p>Not necessarily just for Budtenders, consumers can also benefit from this information and improve their experience with the product and their own personal consumption. Knowledge is most helpful when it is spread as far as possible. So enjoy my basic little site and I'll get rolling on new features as I learn how to create them!</p>
